 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at

 * <p>
 * DEFINITION<br/>
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer
 * points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.<br/>
 * EXAMPLE<br/>
 * input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]<br/>
 * output: C
